# Baccarat

I tried implementing few design patterns for this card game. I used the below design patterns:

**Singleton Pattern**
As I needed only 1 deck of cards which can be reused, I implemented this class as a singleton class.

**Iteratore Pattern**
Instead of creating 52 individual cards, I used an ArrayList to store the individual cards and iterate over them.

**MVC Framework**
I have tried to implement this game using the Model - View - Controller Framework
Model - All classes related to Cards such as Cards, Deck and Hand
View - Simulation Class
Controller - GameController Class

I created few unit tests which can be replicated to perform unit tests.

Below is the screenshot when the user wants to run 1 simulation:
